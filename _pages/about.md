I'm Colin. This is my little corner of the internet where I post about what I am currently working on. 

I am passionate about applying data science to a diverse range of fields, but I tend to gravitate towards problems that involve operations research, customer-level marketing strategy, and urban science. 

You can find more detail on my programming projects [on my Github page](https://github.com/7cb15).

What I'm Working On Right Now
======

Excited to start the Spring Semester of my Master of Science program at [NYU CUSP](http://cusp.nyu.edu/). Course work this semester includes: Applied machine learning, deep learning, big data management platforms (Spark, Hadoop, Hive), and a course on processing and analyzing remote sensing data (image, video, sound, high frequency gps, etc).

Coding

I continue to collaborate on projects with [ARGO Labs](http://www.argolabs.org/) as a Data Science Intern. We're wrapping up a project that predicts [snow water equivalent in the Sierra Mountains](https://github.com/California-Data-Collaborative/snowbot), including a bot that posts the daily estimates to Twitter.

I am a co-author on a forthcoming journal article, Anomaly Detection in Temporal Networks, which I am working on with Professor Stanislav Sobolevsky (NYU and MIT) to be presented at [NetSCIâ€™2019](http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/netsci/).

As always, I'm playing around in the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) sandbox, [classifying faults in power lines](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection#description) and [predicting earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction?utm_medium=email&utm_source=intercom&utm_campaign=comp-launch-lanl). 

Some other data sets I am currently playing with: [GDELT](https://gdeltproject.org), [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), and [Global Fishing watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/datasets-and-code/). 

Camera

Since I'm living in Brooklyn I thought it would be fitting to work on a photo project highlighting American cities. This is one-part an excuse to travel to cities around the country and one-part an excuse to get better at architecture photography. Upcoming cities to document include Philadelphia and Baltimore.

Cooking

I am currently turning my apartment into a mini-culinary lab while I test homemade recipes for kimchi, preserved lemons and other pickled things. Provided no mason jars explode, updates with pictures and recipes are coming soon.
